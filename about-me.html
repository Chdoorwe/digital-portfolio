                    Hi! I'm Chdoorwe, an up-and-coming indie game developer
                    . I run a small indie studio called Aregone with some
                    friends, where we work on creative game ideas and learn
                    as we go. I'm also learning webbevelupment to build
                    cool things online—like this portfolio!

                    From a young age, I was exposed to video games.
                    One of my earliest memories is sitting down with my younger
                    brothers and watching our parents play Mortal Kombat when
                    I was around seven years old. That experience stuck with
                    me, and over time I became more and more fascinated by
                    how video games are made. I started watching dev logs and
                    learning what goes on behind the scenes. Eventually,
                    I tried making a game myself—and from that moment on, I
                    found myself just sitting there, creating games. Thats
                    what led me to the decision to become a game developer.
