                truing them in to a similar crestline starcher as the web stuff now being named opal web . and i have
                sent a request for the research Department on seeing if there any mentioning of any thing like the
                Spider opal and take a closer look at the the crestline starcher that was disposable personal (Class id

                The research Department have came back with some revelations about the opal web crystals if exposed to
                high temps can cause the structure of the crystals to fall apart. Also during the ten days I keep
                hearing voices coming from the room telling me to enter the room and join them. But when I look through
                the window to the containment chamber I see no one in the room but the beauty of the Spider Opal. But I
                will schedule an appointment with Ms. Clois to get a psyche evaluation to make sure that I'm not going
                mad and also to see Ms. Clois.
