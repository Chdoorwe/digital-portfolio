                        The Spider Opal was discovered in the home of (Redacted) in (Redacted), USA. It was assigned the
                        Chaos classification with mild danger levels, being under constant monitoring after the incident
                        with
                        Dr. (Redacted). The following documents include Dr. (Redacted)’s journal and other forms that
                        she
                        filed, or were filed by others, about the incident.

                    From the mutable day of monitoring the opal, as time continues, the crystalline structure forming
                    in the corner is starting to resemble a web-like structure with small moving things on it. Closer
                    examination will need to be done. I will send in one of our disposable personnel.

                    A re-evaluation of classification will need to be done due to the web-like crystalline structure
                    consuming the disposable personnel I sent in. After touching the crystalline structure, the small
                    moving dots now being named “Opal Spiders” covered the disposable personnel, turning them into a
                    similar crystalline structure. The web-like material is now being named “Opal Web.” I have sent a
                    request to the Research Department to see if there are any mentions of anything like the Spider
                    Opal, and to take a closer look at the crystalline structure that was once disposable personnel
                    (Class ID: UU-19.15-202008-C).

                    The Research Department has come back with some revelations about the Opal Web crystals: if exposed
                    to high temperatures, the structure of the crystals will fall apart. Also, during the past ten days
                    I have kept hearing voices coming from the room, telling me to enter and join them. But when I look
                    through the window into the containment chamber, I see no one in the room only the beauty of the
                    Spider Opal. I will schedule an appointment with Ms. Clois to get a psyche evaluation to make sure
                    that I am not going mad, and also to see Ms. Clois.
